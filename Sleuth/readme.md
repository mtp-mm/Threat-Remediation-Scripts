# Sleuth Remediation script

### Actions
- Terminates processes associated with Sleuth
- Remove Sleuth from the file system.
- Removes Sleuth Launch Agent.

### Description
I have created a script to remove Sleuth. The script requires the username to be manually entered. I plan to automate this eventually, but it needs further testing.
